# Run compilation inside golang container, with pachyderm mounted
# Explanation of mounts
# ---------------------
# - _out is where the binaries built in this docker image are written out for
#   us to use:
#     /out <- ./_out
#
# - $HOME/.cache/go-build holds cached docker builds; mounting it makes builds
#   faster:
#     /root/.cache/go-build <- $HOME/.cache/go-build
#
# - Mouting the whole pachyderm repo (including the pachyderm client and this
#   benchmark) makes this benchmark available to be built. Mounting all of it in
#   together (rather than e.g. mounting just this dir and having the pachdyerm
#   repo in ./vendor) means that parallel changes can be made to the benchmark,
#   server, and client simultaneously:
#     /go/src/.../pachyderm <- $GOPATH/src/.../pachyerm/
#
# - Mounting src/server/vendor into src/client/vendor is necessary to build the
#   pachyderm client (which the 'split' supervisor depends on, and which has
#   dependencies but has no vendor directory). It accomplishes a similar goal to
#   the mainline pachyderm's 'make docker-build' directive, which symlinks
#   src/server/vendor into the client:
#     /go/src/../pachyderm/src/client/vendor <- $GOPATH/.../pachyderm/src/server/vendor
#
# - Mounting ./_out into src/client/vendor/.../pachyderm avoids a stupid bug
#   where src/client/vendor/github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/src/client fails to
#   build because of recursive dependencies. We break the recursive dependency
#   of the client on itself by mounting a directory over it that contains no go
#   code:
#     /go/src/../pachyderm/src/client/vendor/github.com/pachyderm/ <- ./_out
